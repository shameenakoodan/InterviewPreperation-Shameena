# Cloud 

### What
    Cloud is a  massive network of computers owned by different providers like AWS
    Azure and GCP which we pay for and use to deploy our applications.
### How
    Deployed a nodejs application with MongoDB on AWS. Currently  working on a React  application that should be deployed on AWS and to use AWS s3 bucket for storing  files.
### Benefits
    Cost is the massive benefit because we only pay for what we use. We dont have to   worry about set up cost. We have multiavailablity of resources that means data and   applications are available at all time with limited outages.If one server   goes down other is available.Integrations are much more easier in cloud  

# DevOPS

### What
    DevOPS is a combination of culture and a way of working. DevOPS is a model of   working were development and operations teams merge and work together  where they   work on the entire life cycle of the application starting from dev environment   setup,application development,testing and deploying the applications.A devops   engineer typically automates a job.  

### How
    Currently working on a project to be deployed on cloud which should have a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment  
### Benefits
    * Faster than traditional   
    * Continous delivery :   
    * Cost effective : We can spin down an app if it is not more required which saves a   lot of money  
    * Efficiency and effectivenes -evrything should be easy to use.
